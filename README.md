# mirPLOT


Here you can download the scripts used for generating the miRNA plots for "The microRNA toolkit of insects".


mirPLOT_v03.py calls external scripts from "/scripts" in order to produce the different plots depending on input data. However the scripts from that directory can also be used independently.

The "useful_scripts" directory, contains some scripts that might be useful for pre-processing miRNA data.
